5. File: USCB_CensusData.csv.
Description: Annual, county-level population size estimates for 1990 - 2017.

Date accessed: October, 2018.

6. File: HealthInsuranceCoverageData_2005to2017.csv.
Description: Annual estimates on the percent of county residents with health insurance coverage for 2005 - 2017.

8. File: RCP45_ForecastedClimate&LandCover.csv.
Description: Forecasted climate and land cover variables for 2040 - 2050 and 2090 - 2100 under moderate climate change scenario (RCP 4.5). Climate variables - average winter temperature, average spring precipitation, the number of hot & dry days, cumulative temperature, cumulative precipitation, temperature variance, and precipitation variance - were calculated using modeled, daily data on near-surface air temperature and precipitation. Land cover variables - percent forest cover and percent mechanically disturbed land -  were calculated using land cover projections.
Climate data source: NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, accessed through the Earth System Grid Federation.
Date accessed: September, 2019.
Land cover data source: USGS Earth Resources Observation and Science Center.
Date accessed: November, 2019.

9. File: RCP85_ForecastedClimate&LandCover.csv.
Forecasted climate and land cover variables under upper climate change scenario (RCP 8.5). See above.
